Schemeken is the marriage of:

  * [Ken](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/~tpkelly/Ken/), a platform for fault-Tolerant distributed computing.
  * Slip, a Scheme interpreter developed by Prof. Theo D'Hondt. It is a lean interpreter written in C to teach students the basics of language interpreters and virtual machines in a course on [Programming Language Engineering](http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tjdhondt/PLE).
